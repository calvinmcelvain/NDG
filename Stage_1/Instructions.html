            General Information:
        </h2>
        <p style="font: 13px">
            Today you are participating in an experiment in decision-making. The instructions describe how you will interact with the computer system and other participants. To make money you must follow the instructions closely. There are three stages in this experiment, with 16 rounds in each stage. The following instructions describe the initial stage. You will be given additional instructions explaining how the rules will change for the remaining two stages of the experiment.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Payoffs in Dollars and Confidentiality:
        </h2>
        <p>
            All payoffs during the experiment are denominated in an artificial currency, experimental currency units (ECU). At the end of the experiment, ECU will be converted to cash at the rate of 500 ECU = $1. Upon completion of the experiment, you will be paid your converted earnings plus the $5 show-up fee in cash. The exact amount you receive will be determined during the experiment and will depend on your decisions and the decisions of others. You will be paid privately, and no other participant will be told what you earned for the experiment. You should feel free to make as much money as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            All information about your choices and payoffs will be kept confidential. Specifically, at no point in time will we identify the role or choices of any individual to other participants.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Rules for the Experiment:
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you have any questions during the experiment, please raise your hand and wait for an experimenter to come to you. Please do not talk, exclaim, or try to communicate with other participants during the experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are carrying a smartphone or similar electronic device, please turn it off and put it away for the duration of the experiment. Please do not take out any of your electronic devices at any point during the experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the instructions for this experiment have been completed, please keep your eyes on your own computer screen. Please do not attempt to look at the screens of other experimental participants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Participants violating these rules or otherwise behaving in a disruptive fashion will be asked to leave the experiment and will not be paid.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Roles, Rounds, and Matchings:
        </h2>
        <p>
            At the beginning of Stage 1, you will be assigned a role as either Player 1 or Player 2. You will keep this role for the entire stage.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are 10 rounds in Stage 1. For each round, you will be randomly paired with a person in the other role.  In other words, you will be matched with a DIFFERENT person in each round. In each round, you and the person matched with you will play a game.  Each of you will make a decision, and your payoffs for the round will be determined by this pair of decisions.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <p>
        In each round, you and the person matched with you will choose between two options. Player 1 chooses a row, either A or B, and Player 2 picks a column, either C or D.  You will not know the other person’s choice when you make your decision, and they will not know your choice when they make theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The payoff table for Stage 1 is shown to the right. Everyone in today’s session has the same payoff table. Player 1’s payoff is in red in the lower left corner of a cell and the Player 2’s payoff is in blue in the upper right.
